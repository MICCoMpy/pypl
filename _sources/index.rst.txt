Welcome to the documentation of PyPL |version|
==============================================

**PyPL** is designed to compute vibrationally resolved spectra of point defects.

Features:

   - Calculation of vibrationally resolved photoluminescence and absorption spectra using Huang-Rhys theory and the generating function approach.
   - Calculation of vibrationally resolved optical spectra using the one-dimensional configurational coordinate diagram (1D CCD) approach.
